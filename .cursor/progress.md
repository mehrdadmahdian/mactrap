# Progress Status

## ‚úÖ Working Features
- **Startup Delay**: 5-second delay after executable launch before monitoring begins
- **Less Intrusive Notification**: Simplified popup that auto-dismisses after 3 seconds
- **Input Detection**: Successfully monitors HIDIdleTime via ioreg
- **Activity Detection**: Reliably detects mouse and keyboard input  
- **Camera Photo Capture**: Takes timestamped photos using imagesnap with 2s warmup
- **Photo File Management**: Organized storage in `mac-trap-photos/` with timestamps
- **Screen Locking**: Functional screen lock via osascript after photo capture
- **Dependency Check**: Validates imagesnap availability on startup with user feedback
- **Error Handling**: Graceful camera failure handling with fallback to screen lock
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ctrl+C handling works properly without triggering actions
- **Monitoring Loop**: 1-second polling with ticker implementation
- **Response Sequence**: Complete photo‚Üílock‚Üíexit workflow

## üöß Current Work
- None - camera functionality fully implemented

## üìã Future Enhancement Ideas
- **Custom Storage Location**: Configurable photo directory
- **Photo Quality Options**: Different resolution/format settings
- **Silent Mode**: Option to run without console output
- **Multiple Camera Support**: Select specific camera device
- **Photo Cleanup**: Automatic deletion of old photos
- **Notification Integration**: macOS notification when triggered

## üêõ Known Issues
- Minor linter warning about `for range` vs `for { select {} }` (acceptable for this use case)

## üéØ Complete Implementation
‚úÖ **Mac-trap with Camera** - Full security monitoring with photo evidence
1. ‚úÖ Camera photo capture functionality
2. ‚úÖ Updated detection response sequence  
3. ‚úÖ Photo file management with timestamps
4. ‚úÖ Camera permissions and error handling
5. ‚úÖ Updated documentation for camera features

## ‚ö° Performance Notes
- 1-second polling interval provides responsive detection
- 2-second camera warmup ensures quality photos
- System command execution is fast and reliable
- Memory usage remains minimal with photo functionality
- Graceful degradation when camera unavailable
