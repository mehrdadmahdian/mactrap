# Progress Status

## ✅ Working Features
- **Startup Delay**: 5-second delay after executable launch before monitoring begins
- **Less Intrusive Notification**: Simplified popup that auto-dismisses after 3 seconds
- **Input Detection**: Successfully monitors HIDIdleTime via ioreg
- **Activity Detection**: Reliably detects mouse and keyboard input  
- **Camera Photo Capture**: Takes timestamped photos using imagesnap with 2s warmup
- **Photo File Management**: Organized storage in `mac-trap-photos/` with timestamps
- **Screen Locking**: Functional screen lock via osascript after photo capture
- **Dependency Check**: Validates imagesnap availability on startup with user feedback
- **Error Handling**: Graceful camera failure handling with fallback to screen lock
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ctrl+C handling works properly without triggering actions
- **Monitoring Loop**: 1-second polling with ticker implementation
- **Response Sequence**: Complete photo→lock→exit workflow

## 🚧 Current Work
- None - camera functionality fully implemented

## 📋 Future Enhancement Ideas
- **Custom Storage Location**: Configurable photo directory
- **Photo Quality Options**: Different resolution/format settings
- **Silent Mode**: Option to run without console output
- **Multiple Camera Support**: Select specific camera device
- **Photo Cleanup**: Automatic deletion of old photos
- **Notification Integration**: macOS notification when triggered

## 🐛 Known Issues
- Minor linter warning about `for range` vs `for { select {} }` (acceptable for this use case)

## 🎯 Complete Implementation
✅ **Mac-trap with Camera** - Full security monitoring with photo evidence
1. ✅ Camera photo capture functionality
2. ✅ Updated detection response sequence  
3. ✅ Photo file management with timestamps
4. ✅ Camera permissions and error handling
5. ✅ Updated documentation for camera features

## ⚡ Performance Notes
- 1-second polling interval provides responsive detection
- 2-second camera warmup ensures quality photos
- System command execution is fast and reliable
- Memory usage remains minimal with photo functionality
- Graceful degradation when camera unavailable
