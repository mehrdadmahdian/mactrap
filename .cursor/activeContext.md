# Active Context

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Office Security Monitor with Enhanced UX** - Fully functional workplace security tool with improved user experience and startup behavior.

## Recently Completed
- **Dutch Language Interface**: Translated popup notification to Dutch while keeping security message structure
- **Less Intrusive Popup**: Modified startup notification to auto-dismiss after 3 seconds
- **5-Second Startup Delay**: Added delay after executable launch before monitoring begins
- **Better User Experience**: Maintains security functionality with improved UX
- **Consent Dialog System**: Added AppleScript modal requiring user acceptance
- **Office Security Context**: Rebranded for legitimate workplace monitoring
- **Transparent Process**: Users fully informed before any monitoring occurs
- **Choice & Control**: Users can decline consent (system locks immediately)
- **Professional UI**: Clear office security notice with proper messaging
- **Completion Notifications**: Users notified when security documentation complete

## Implementation Details
- **Photo Method**: `takePhoto()` with timestamped filename generation
- **Detection Handler**: `handleDetection()` orchestrates photo‚Üílock‚Üíexit sequence
- **Directory Creation**: Automatic `mac-trap-photos/` directory creation
- **User Feedback**: Clear console messages and emojis for better UX
- **Graceful Degradation**: Works even without camera, warns user appropriately
